# Hugo PERRAIN CA1 IIM assessment

## Requirement 

to run this app :

```npm install
```

# BrandAPI

For this project, the first step was to create a class including properties like String, Boolean, Array, Integers

After that comes the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) which give us a complete maintain of our class. 

We need to install express.js (npm install express), it allows us to test our app on a server by running "node index.js".

Then we used Postman to test all CRUD methods, POST to add data, GET to display datas, PUT to modify data in our class, and DELETE to delete data.

These datas are stocked in MongoDB, which give us a link that we put on our index.js. We may go to Databases > View monitoring > Collection to see our datas on MongoDB
